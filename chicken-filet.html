 <h1>Pan-Roasted Chicken Breasts</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This chicken breast skillet recipe is fast, easy, and delicious. You can easily monitor the internal temperature of the meat when pan-roasting chicken. Leaving the skin on adds a lot of flavor and much-needed moisture.</p>
    <p> I used apple cider vinegar, but any vinegar will work. Some of my favorites are sherry, balsamic, rice, and champagne vinegar.</p>
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
       <li>4 boneless chicken breast halves with skin</li>
       <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
       <li>Â¼ cup apple cider vinegar</li>
       <li>4 tablespoons cold butter, cut into small pieces</li>
       <li>1 tablespoon chicken broth (or water), if needed to thin sauce</li>
       <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh herbs (thyme, parsley, rosemary) (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
   <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
       <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
       <li>Season chicken on both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
       <li>Heat olive oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it starts to shimmer. Place chicken breasts skin-side down in the skillet. Sprinkle with fresh herbs. Cook until the bottoms are well seared and golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
       <li>Flip chicken breasts over and continue cooking until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a breast reads 150 degrees F (66 degrees C), about 5 minutes.</li>
       <li>Add vinegar and cold butter to the pan with chicken. Shake the pan gently until butter melts and the internal temperature of chicken reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 2 to 3 minutes more.</li>
       <li>Stir in 1 tablespoon chicken broth to thin sauce.</li>
    </ol>
